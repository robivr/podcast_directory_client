# Podcast Directory client

This is a simple podcast directory written in React. It uses the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) API to get the podcast data.

The home page shows 12 podcasts that are trending, users can search for their favorite podcasts and listen to podcast episodes.

## Demo

An online demo can be found [here](https://podcast-directory.netlify.app/).

_NOTE: The server is hosted on a free plan and goes to sleep after some time of inactivity. It might take up to 30 seconds to wake up and serve the podcasts._
