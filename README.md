# Podcast Directory

Welcome to the Podcast Directory, a web application that allows users to explore and listen to their favorite podcasts. With this app, users can view trending podcasts, search for specific podcasts, and listen to podcast episodes.

The app was built using React and utilizes React Router for client-side routing and React Context for state management. The app also makes use of APIs to fetch podcast data and a simple backend server built with Node.js and Express.

## Demo

An online demo can be found [here](https://podcast-directory.netlify.app/).

_NOTE: The server is hosted on a free plan and goes to sleep after some time of inactivity. It might take up to 30 seconds to wake up and serve the podcasts._

Through building this project, I learned how to:

- Use React Router for client-side routing
- Implement state management using React Context
- Consume APIs to fetch and display data
